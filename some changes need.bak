 Next step ideas (you can pick one to implement next):

Session Resetting

Allow the bot to “forget everything” on command (like typing /reset).

Context Control

Only load the last N facts + summaries into context when generating a reply (keeps responses sharp and efficient).

User Profiles

Store persistent info like name, interests, etc. separately from chat history.

Memory Expiry

Add a timestamp to facts and auto-delete them after X days.

Vector Search (later)

Instead of storing only text, you can embed facts in a vector database for smarter recall.
