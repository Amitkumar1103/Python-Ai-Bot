Project 1: AI Agent with Memory

Tech Stack

Python (core language) ✅

OpenAI API (ChatGPT) → for AI responses ✅

SQLite or JSON → for memory storage **(on going)**

Streamlit / Flask (optional) → for a simple web UI

SpeechRecognition + pyttsx3 (optional) → for voice

after all things we need to setup like before start check requirement files are available or not

Roadmap
1 import gemini ai api (done)
2 making simple code that takes user input and give it to ai and get respone in realtime until i input exit (done)
3 making memory system thats take user input and ai respone and save it to json file for latter use everytime i enter something its
call that file and check its already written or not for work like brain (currently making)
steps:
Start
│
▼
Check if memory.json exists
│
├── Yes → Load previous memory into a list
│
└── No → Create empty memory list
│
▼
Start Chat Loop (until user types "exit")
│
▼
User types a message
│
▼
Append user message to memory list
│
▼
Send full memory list + new input to AI (Gemini)
│
▼
AI generates a reply
│
▼
Append AI reply to memory list
│
▼
Save updated memory list back to memory.json
│
▼
Go back to Chat Loop
│
└── If user types "exit" → End
